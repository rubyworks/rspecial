summary: RSpec on Assay
title: RSpecish
version: 0.3.0
name: rspecish
description: ! 'RSpecish defines a set of RSpec-compatible matcher methods which

  convert seemlessly to Assay assertions. This allows developers to

  change to BRASS compliant test frameworks without having to change

  a slew of previously written RSpec-based specifications.'
